# School_Projects
A compilation of assignments from various courses taken at the University of Pittsburgh during the 2016-2017 school year.

## ASLDictionary.iOS

This project was built using Micsrosoft Visual Studio and C#. It is a mobile application for the iOS platform which serves as a video dictionary for the University of Pittsburgh's American Sign Language 1 and 2 courses.

## CS1550 - Introduction to Operating Systems

This folder contains two projects from the Introduction to Operating Systems course I took my senior year at Pitt. Both projects are written in C.

## CS1635 - Interface Design Methodology

This course focussed on the key principles and concepts relevant to designing functional, aesthetic user interfaces for mobile devices. It also went into core principles for team development such the Agile model. Development for the course was done on the Android platform so both individual assignments and the group project contained in this folder are Android projects.

## CS1675 - Introduction to Machine Learning

This introductory machine learning course gave an overview of many models and algorithms used in modern machine learning including linear models, multi-layer neural networks, support vector machines, density estimation methods, Bayesian belief networks, clustering, ensemble methods, and reinforcement of learning. The course presented the basic ideas and intuition behind these methods, as well as, a more formal understanding of how and why they work. 

Contained in this folder are several homework assignments from the course which include code written in Matlab and a report in PDF format analyzing the data and answering questions regarding each assignment.

## CS1699 - Special Topics in Cloud Computing

This course introduced the fundamental concepts and building blocks of Cloud Computing and provided an in-depth study of its enabling technologies and tools. The main topics of the course included cloud computing design issues, software and services, data center architecture and design, virtualization and cloud computational models, cloud programming models, large-scale data processing models, and storage technologies and services.

Contained in this folder are several homework assignments coded using various cloud and big data technologies. The technologies used were Hadoop, Spark (code written in Scala), Pig, and Hive. Also included is a small "Tiny Google" search engine which scans all the files contained in the directory it is instructed to search (on an HDFS) and uses the term frequency-inverse document frequency algorithm to rank and retrieve the top five results along with a short excerpt from each file. This search engine exists in two forms, one which utilizes Hadoop (Project 1) and another which utilizes Spark (Project 2).
